### Discription
A program which will take an array of ints and sort it using a bubble sort algorithm and then a merge sort algorithm. Include JUnit tests for this and all subsequent phases (and all subsequent projects for the rest of time). I implements MVC and a basic factory pattern to determine which sorter to use. added logging code into the Sort Manager project. Set up log4j in the project and add a properties file. I have Integrated a new class to implement a binary search tree approach for sorting.
